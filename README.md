## Try it Now

**Option A — Claude Code with MCP (Recommended)**

Add the Dossier MCP server to enable automatic verification:

**Step 1**: Create or edit `~/.claude/settings.local.json`
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "dossier": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@dossier/mcp-server"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Step 2**: Restart Claude Code to load the MCP server

---

**Option B — Command-Line Verification (Works Anywhere)**

Verify dossier security before execution:

```bash
# Clone the repo and use the CLI verification tool
git clone https://github.com/imboard-ai/dossier.git
cd dossier
chmod +x cli/bin/dossier-verify
cli/bin/dossier-verify examples/git-project-review/atomic/readme-reality-check.ds.md
```

---

**Option C — Try with Any LLM (Zero Installation)**

Copy this into any LLM chat (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini):
```markdown
# dossier: hello-world
version: 1.0
objective: Print a friendly greeting and verify success.
steps:
  - "Print: Hello from Dossier 👋"
validate:
  - "Output contains: Hello from Dossier"
success: "You saw the greeting."
```

**Expected result**: The LLM will print "Hello from Dossier 👋" and confirm success.

---

## Why Use Dossier?

**"How is this different from AGENTS.md files?"** Many projects already use files like `AGENTS.md` or `.cursorrules` for AI context. Here's the key distinction:

|  | AGENTS.md | Dossier |
|--|-----------|---------|
| **Purpose** | Project context & conventions | Executable workflow automation |
| **Validation** | None | Built-in success criteria |
| **Security** | None | Checksums + cryptographic signatures |
| **Portability** | Project-specific | Cross-project, shareable |
| **Tooling** | None | CLI verification, MCP integration |
| **Versioning** | Informal | Semantic versioning (v1.0.0) |

**They're complementary**: Use AGENTS.md to explain *your project*, use dossiers to automate *workflows*.

Ask your LLM:
```
Analyze my project using the readme-reality-check dossier from:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/imboard-ai/dossier/main/examples/git-project-review/atomic/readme-reality-check.ds.md
```

---

## Security & Verification

- Use the CLI tool (`cli/bin/dossier-verify`) to verify checksums/signatures before execution
- Prefer MCP mode for sandboxed, permissioned operations
- See [SECURITY_STATUS.md](./SECURITY_STATUS.md) for current guarantees and limitations

---

## Adopter Playbooks

- **Solo Dev**: paste a `.ds.md` into your LLM and run via MCP or CLI
- **OSS Maintainer**: add `/dossiers` + a CI check that runs the Reality Check on your README
- **Platform Team**: start with init → deploy → rollback dossiers; wire secrets & scanners

# Understanding Dossiers

**Dossiers** are intelligent instruction files that leverage LLM agents to automate complex workflows with adaptability and continuous improvement.

---

## What Are Dossiers?

A **dossier** is a structured instruction file (`.ds.md`) that an AI agent can execute. Instead of writing complex scripts that try to handle every edge case, dossiers provide **clear instructions** that LLM agents (like Claude Code, GPT-4, Cursor, Copilot) can follow intelligently.

> **❓ Questions?** See [FAQ](docs/explanation/faq.md) for common objections and detailed comparisons to alternatives (AGENTS.md, scripts, CI/CD, frameworks).

### The Concept

Modern developers **already have access to LLMs** in their workflows—82% use ChatGPT, 43% use GitHub Copilot[^17][^18][^19][^20]! So why write brittle shell scripts when we can provide structured guidance for intelligent agents?

**Traditional Approach** (brittle)[^21][^22][^23]:
```bash
# Complex script with 200+ lines
# Must handle: all project types, all edge cases, all errors
# Breaks when encountering unexpected setup
./setup-wizard.sh
```

**Dossier Approach** (adaptive):
```markdown
# Clear instructions for intelligent agent
# Agent adapts to actual project context
# Handles edge cases naturally through understanding
```

### Dossiers vs. AGENTS.md Files

**Key difference**: AGENTS.md files provide **project-level context** (architecture, conventions), while dossiers provide **workflow-level automation** with validation and security.

**They're complementary**: Use AGENTS.md for project understanding + dossiers for specific tasks. See [FAQ](docs/explanation/faq.md) for detailed comparison with concrete examples.

---

## 🔄 Self-Improving Dossiers

**One of Dossier's unique features**: Dossiers can improve through execution, learning from your project's specific needs.

Dossiers follow the **Dossier Execution Protocol** ([PROTOCOL](docs/reference/protocol.md)) which includes a **self-improvement system**.[^15][^16]

### How It Works

**Every dossier execution** is an opportunity to improve the dossier:

1. **Before executing**: LLM analyzes dossier quality
2. **Context-aware**: Identifies improvements based on YOUR project
3. **Suggests enhancements**: Proposes specific additions/refinements
4. **You decide**: Accept, iterate, or skip
5. **Continuously improves**: Dossiers get better with each use

**Example**:
```
User: "Use project-init dossier"

LLM: 🔄 Improvement Suggestion
     Your project has Python venv/ but dossier doesn't check for it.
     Should I add Python virtual environment detection? (y/N)

User: "yes"

LLM: ✓ Enhanced dossier with Python support
     ✓ Executing improved version...
```

**Protocol Version**: Each dossier specifies which protocol version it follows (e.g., v1.0)

📚 **Full protocol**: [PROTOCOL.md](./PROTOCOL.md)

---

## 🌐 Open Protocol, Not Vendor Lock-In

**A common question at this point**: "Who controls this protocol? Am I locked into a vendor?"

**Short answer**: You control it. Dossier is an open protocol, not a proprietary system.

Dossiers are an **OPEN PROTOCOL**, like Docker containers or HTTP - not a proprietary system:

### What "Open Protocol" Means

- ✅ **Specification is open source** - Full protocol publicly documented
- ✅ **Anyone can create dossiers** - No permission or licensing required
- ✅ **Anyone can execute dossiers** - Works with any LLM (Claude, GPT, Gemini, local models)
- ✅ **No external dependencies** - Dossiers are local markdown files
- ✅ **Multiple implementations encouraged** - Build your own tools and executors
- ✅ **Community-driven evolution** - Protocol changes via RFC process

### Governance Model

| Aspect | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Protocol specification | Open (Apache 2.0 after 2028, BSL 1.1 now) |
| Creating dossiers | Free & open |
| Executing dossiers | No restrictions |
| Tooling | Open source + optional commercial services |
| Protocol changes | Semantic versioning + community input |

**Think of it like**:
- **Docker**: Open container spec, optional registry services
- **Git**: Open protocol, optional hosting (GitHub, GitLab)
- **HTTP**: Open standard, various implementations

### What We Provide (Optional)

- Registry hosting (you can self-host)
- Signing key management (you can use your own keys)
- Premium tools (basic tools are open source)
- Enterprise support

**Your dossiers are yours** - stored in your repos, executable locally, no external calls required.

**See [FAQ.md § Protocol & Governance](./FAQ.md#protocol--governance) for detailed trust model.**

---

## 🔒 Security & Trust

Dossiers contain executable instructions, so **security is critical**. The Dossier system includes multiple layers of protection:

### Integrity Verification (Required)

Every dossier includes a **SHA256 checksum** to verify it hasn't been tampered with:

```json
{
  "checksum": {
    "algorithm": "sha256",
    "hash": "a3b5c8d9e1f2..."
  }
}
```

**Before execution**, LLM agents must verify the checksum matches the dossier content. If it doesn't match → **BLOCK execution**.

### Cryptographic Signatures (Optional)

Dossiers can be **signed with minisign** to verify authenticity:

```json
{
  "signature": {
    "algorithm": "minisign",
    "public_key": "RWT...",
    "signature": "...",
    "signed_by": "Imboard AI <security@imboard.ai>"
  }
}
```

**Trust levels:**
- ✅ **VERIFIED**: Signed by a key you trust
- ⚠️  **SIGNED_UNKNOWN**: Valid signature, unknown signer
- ⚠️  **UNSIGNED**: No signature (integrity still checked)
- ❌ **INVALID**: Signature failed → **BLOCK execution**

### Risk Assessment

Every dossier declares its risk level and operations:

```json
{
  "risk_level": "high",
  "risk_factors": ["modifies_cloud_resources", "requires_credentials"],
  "requires_approval": true,
  "destructive_operations": [
    "Creates/updates AWS infrastructure",
    "Modifies IAM roles"
  ]
}
```

**High-risk dossiers require user approval** before execution.

### Verification Tools

```bash
# Verify integrity + authenticity
node tools/verify-dossier.js path/to/dossier.md

# Sign a dossier (authors)
node tools/sign-dossier.js path/to/dossier.md --key your-key.key
```
### Trust Model

Like Docker Hub, Dossier uses **decentralized trust**:
- **Official dossiers**: Signed with AWS KMS by Imboard AI (see [KEYS.txt](./KEYS.txt))
- **Community dossiers**: Signed with minisign by their authors
- **You decide**: Which keys to trust in `~/.dossier/trusted-keys.txt`

📚 **Security Documentation**:
- **[security/](./security/)** - Complete security documentation hub
- **[SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md)** - Vulnerability disclosure policy
- **[security/ARCHITECTURE.md](./security/ARCHITECTURE.md)** - Security architecture
- **[security/THREAT_MODEL.md](./security/THREAT_MODEL.md)** - Threat analysis
- **[security/KEY_MANAGEMENT.md](./security/KEY_MANAGEMENT.md)** - Key lifecycle management

## MCP Server Integration

### What is the MCP Server?

The **Dossier MCP Server** is a [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) integration that enables Claude Code (and other MCP-compatible tools) to:

- ⚡ **Automatically verify** dossier security (checksums, signatures)
- 📋 **Discover dossiers** with natural language queries
- 🔒 **Validate authenticity** using cryptographic signatures
- 📖 **Access protocol documentation** built-in
- 🚀 **Streamline execution** with fewer manual steps

### Why Use MCP Server?

**Without MCP Server**:
```
User: "run deploy-to-aws.ds.md"

Claude: "Let me read that file..."
        *Reads file manually*
        "I need to verify the checksum manually..."
        *Guides user through verification*
        "Now let's check the risk level..."
        *Manual risk assessment*
        (5-10 minutes of manual steps)
```

**With MCP Server**:
```
User: "run deploy-to-aws.ds.md"

Claude: *Calls verify_dossier() automatically*
        "✅ Checksum verified
         ⚠️  Unsigned (no signature)
         🔴 High risk: modifies cloud resources

         Proceed? (y/N)"

(Automatic verification in 2 seconds)
```

### Quick Setup

**One-time setup** (5-10 minutes):

```
In Claude Code: "run examples/setup/setup-dossier-mcp.ds.md"
```

This interactive dossier will guide you through configuration.

**Or manually configure**:

1. Edit `~/.claude/settings.local.json`
2. Add:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "dossier": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": ["-y", "@dossier/mcp-server"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```
3. Restart Claude Code

### With vs Without MCP

| Feature | Without MCP | With MCP |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| **Security Verification** | Manual (5-10 min) | Automatic (2 sec) |
| **Checksum Validation** | Calculate manually | ✅ Automatic |
| **Signature Verification** | External tool needed | ✅ Built-in |
| **Risk Assessment** | Read manually | ✅ Structured display |
| **Dossier Discovery** | File search | ✅ Natural language |
| **Protocol Access** | Read PROTOCOL.md | ✅ Built-in resource |
| **Trust Management** | Manual key checking | ✅ Automatic |

### Configuration Options

#### Option 1: npx (Recommended)

No installation needed - downloads on first use:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "dossier": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@dossier/mcp-server"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Option 2: Global Install

Explicit installation:

```bash
npm install -g @dossier/mcp-server
```

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "dossier": {
      "command": "dossier-mcp-server"
    }
  }
}
```

### Do I Need MCP Server?

**No!** Dossiers work without MCP server - it just makes them better.

- **With MCP**: Automatic verification, streamlined execution
- **Without MCP**: Manual verification, more steps, fully functional

All dossiers support **fallback to manual execution**.

### ⚠️ Important: Security Verification

**Current Reality**: LLMs don't automatically enforce security checks, even with MCP server.

**For mandatory verification**, use the CLI tool:
```bash
# Verify before executing
dossier-verify https://example.com/dossier.ds.md

# Or use wrapper function
claude-run-dossier https://example.com/dossier.ds.md
```

### Why These Examples Matter

These dossiers prove the **universal applicability** of the dossier standard:

| Domain | Example | Complexity | Risk Level |
|--------|---------|-----------|------------|
| **Data Science** | ML Training | Medium | Low (local) |
| **Database** | Schema Migration | High | **Critical** |
| **Frontend** | React Library | Medium | Low (dev tools) |
| **DevOps** | AWS Deploy | High | High (infrastructure) |
| **Code Analysis** | Git Project Review | Low-Medium | None (read-only) |

**Each example includes**:
- ✅ Real, executable code (not placeholders)
- ✅ Complete before/after examples
- ✅ Comprehensive troubleshooting sections
- ✅ Validation procedures
- ✅ Context detection and decision trees
- ✅ LLM-executable instructions

**Domain diversity proves**:
- Dossiers work for **data processing**, **infrastructure**, **development**, and **analysis**
- Handle both **stateless** (ML training) and **stateful** (database) operations
- Support **local** (React library) and **remote** (AWS) execution
- Scale from **no-risk** (read-only analysis) to **critical** (database migration)
- Demonstrate **composability** (atomic analysis building blocks)

---

## Dossiers vs Scripts

Use **both** dossiers and traditional scripts - each for what they do best:

### Use Dossiers When:
- ✅ Context awareness needed (detect project structure)
- ✅ Decisions required (which templates to use)
- ✅ Adaptation needed (handle unexpected setups)
- ✅ User guidance helpful (explain choices)

### Use Scripts When:
- ✅ Inputs are clear and deterministic
- ✅ Fast execution matters
- ✅ No decisions needed
- ✅ Same operation every time

### Examples

| Task | Approach | Why |
|------|----------|-----|
| Set ENV variable | Script ✅ | Simple, deterministic |
| **Initialize project** | **Dossier** ✅ | Needs to understand project |
| Run benchmarks | Script ✅ | Fixed commands |
| **Setup development** | **Dossier** ✅ | Needs context detection |
| Validate config | Script ✅ | Schema checking |
| **Generate config** | **Dossier** ✅ | Needs intelligence |

---

## Prerequisites
What must exist before running this dossier

## Context to Gather
What the LLM should analyze in the project:
- Directory structure
- Existing files
- Git repositories
- Configuration files

## Decision Points
Key choices the LLM needs to make:
- Which template to use
- What values to set
- How to handle edge cases

## Actions to Perform
Step-by-step instructions:
1. Do X
2. Do Y
3. Do Z

## Validation
How to verify success:
- Check file X exists
- Verify Y is valid

## Example
Show what the expected result looks like

## Troubleshooting
Common issues and how to resolve them
```

## 🔬 Dossier Schema (v1.0.0)

**New in v1.0.0**: Dossiers now support **structured JSON metadata** via frontmatter, providing deterministic validation and tooling foundation.

### The Problem: Inconsistency & Ambiguity

Without a schema, LLMs interpret Dossiers based on training. This creates brittleness:

| **Without Schema** | **With Schema** |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| ❌ Ambiguous - LLM must infer metadata | ✅ Deterministic - explicit machine-readable structure |
| ❌ Brittle - model updates can break execution | ✅ Robust - validated before execution |
| ❌ Isolated - hard to search/categorize programmatically | ✅ Integrated - tooling-ready (CLI, IDE, registries) |
| ❌ Unpredictable costs - unknown tool requirements | ✅ Predictable - know tools/deps before execution |

### Why Structure Matters for LLMs

**"LLMs work fine without structure!"** - Yes, but they work BETTER with it[^1][^2]:

1. **Deterministic Parsing**: Extract metadata without LLM interpretation[^3][^4]
   - Without schema: LLM spends tokens figuring out "Where are prerequisites?"
   - With schema: `metadata.prerequisites` is always in the same place (zero parsing cost)

2. **Fast Validation**: Catch errors before expensive LLM execution[^5]
   - Schema validation: milliseconds, zero cost
   - LLM interpretation errors: discovered during expensive execution

3. **Reduced Model Variance**: Clear schema = consistent interpretation[^6][^7][^8]
   - GPT-4 and Claude interpret the same structured dossier identically
   - Freeform markdown can be interpreted differently across models

4. **Tooling Foundation**: Enable CLI tools, IDEs, registries, and automation[^24][^25]
   - Structured metadata = machine-readable
   - CLIs can validate without an LLM
   - IDEs can provide autocomplete
   - Registries can index and search

5. **Predictable Costs**: Know requirements before execution
   - See tool requirements upfront
   - Estimate complexity before LLM call

### Schema Format

Dossiers can include JSON frontmatter at the top of the file:

```markdown

# Dossier: Deploy to AWS

[Rest of markdown content...]
```

### Key Schema Features

**Required Fields**:
- `dossier_schema_version`: Schema version (currently `"1.0.0"`)
- `title`: Dossier name
- `version`: Semantic version
- `protocol_version`: Protocol compliance version
- `status`: Lifecycle status (`Draft`, `Stable`, `Deprecated`, `Experimental`)
- `objective`: Clear, measurable goal statement

**Organization & Discovery**:
- `category`: Primary categories (devops, database, development, etc.)
- `tags`: Free-form tags for searchability
- `tools_required`: List of required CLI tools with versions

**Relationships**:
- `preceded_by`: Dossiers that should run before this one
- `followed_by`: Dossiers that should run after
- `alternatives`: Alternative approaches for similar goals
- `conflicts_with`: Incompatible Dossiers
- `can_run_parallel_with`: Dossiers that can execute simultaneously

**Inputs & Outputs**:
- `inputs.required`: Required parameters with validation
- `inputs.optional`: Optional parameters with defaults
- `outputs.files`: Files created/modified
- `outputs.configuration`: Configuration values produced
- `outputs.artifacts`: Generated scripts, logs, reports

**Validation & Safety**:
- `risk_level`: Risk assessment (`low`, `medium`, `high`, `critical`)
- `prerequisites`: Requirements that must be met
- `validation.success_criteria`: Verifiable success conditions
- `rollback`: Rollback capability information

### Validation Tools

Validate Dossiers programmatically before execution:

**Node.js**:
```bash
cd examples/validation
npm install ajv ajv-formats
node validate-dossier.js ../devops/deploy-to-aws.ds.md
```

**Python**:
```bash
pip install jsonschema
python validate-dossier.py ../devops/deploy-to-aws.ds.md
```

**Output**:
```
🔍 Validating: ../devops/deploy-to-aws.ds.md

✓ Frontmatter extracted successfully
  Title: Deploy to AWS
  Version: 1.0.0
  Status: Stable

✅ VALID - Dossier schema is compliant
```

### Backward Compatibility

**Important**: Dossiers without schema frontmatter remain valid and can be executed by LLM agents. The schema is an **enhancement**, not a breaking change.

- ✅ **Legacy Dossiers**: Pure markdown Dossiers still work
- ✅ **Gradual Adoption**: Add schema to new Dossiers first
- ✅ **Dual Format**: Can keep both JSON frontmatter and markdown metadata during transition

## Creating Custom Dossiers

### Naming Convention

**All dossier files should use the `.ds.md` extension** to clearly identify them as dossier files:

```bash
✅ add-git-worktree-support.ds.md
✅ deploy-to-production.ds.md
✅ setup-development-environment.ds.md

❌ setup-project.md  # Could be regular documentation
❌ dossier-deploy.md # Unclear naming
```

**Benefits**:
- Instantly recognizable as dossier files
- Won't be confused with regular documentation
- Tools can easily glob for `**/*.ds.md`
- Follows common patterns (`.test.js`, `.spec.ts`, etc.)

### 1. Use the Template

Start with the dossier template:

```bash
cp templates/dossier-template.md \
   dossiers/my-custom-dossier.ds.md
```

### 2. Follow the Format

Fill in all sections. Be specific and clear. The LLM will follow your instructions literally.

### 3. Test with an LLM

Try your dossier with an AI assistant. Refine based on results.

### 4. Share with Community

Share useful dossiers! Contribute to dossier implementations or create your own collection.

## Organizing Multiple Dossiers

As your dossier collection grows, organization becomes important. A **dossier registry** helps document relationships, workflows, and navigation paths.

### Why Use a Registry?

When you have multiple dossiers, a registry provides:
- **Quick reference** - Summary table of all dossiers
- **Journey mapping** - Common workflow paths (e.g., greenfield vs brownfield)
- **Relationship documentation** - Which dossiers depend on or complement each other
- **Navigation guidance** - Help users find the right dossier for their needs
- **Output tracking** - What each dossier produces and what consumes it

### Registry Pattern

A dossier registry typically includes:

1. **Quick Reference Table**
   - List all dossiers with version, purpose, and coupling level
   - Helps users scan available automation

2. **Journey Maps**
   - Group dossiers into common workflows
   - Show sequential paths (e.g., "New Project: init → setup → deploy")
   - Visualize with mermaid diagrams

3. **Relationship Matrix**
   - Document dependencies between dossiers
   - Identify sequential, suggested, or conflicting relationships
   - Note coupling levels (loose, medium, tight)

4. **Output Matrix**
   - Track what files/artifacts each dossier creates
   - Document which other dossiers consume those outputs
   - Helps understand data flow

5. **Navigation Guide**
   - User-centric paths ("I want to..." → recommended dossiers)
   - Makes discovery easier for both humans and LLMs

### Example Registry

See **[examples/sample-implementation/dossiers-registry.md](./examples/sample-implementation/dossiers-registry.md)** for a complete example showing:
- Categorization (Setup, Development, Maintenance)
- Journey mapping (Greenfield vs Brownfield paths)
- Relationship and output matrices
- Coupling level classification
- User-centric navigation

### When to Create a Registry

- **3+ dossiers**: Consider a simple list
- **5+ dossiers**: Add categorization and basic relationships
- **10+ dossiers**: Full registry with journeys and matrices

A well-organized registry makes your dossier collection more discoverable and helps LLMs understand how to chain multiple dossiers together intelligently.

## Best Practices

### ✅ Do:
- **Be specific**: "Copy all .md files from tasks/active/" not "get the tasks"
- **Show examples**: Include expected output samples
- **Handle errors**: Include troubleshooting sections
- **Validate results**: Always include validation steps
- **Be LLM-agnostic**: Don't use Claude-specific features

### ❌ Don't:
- **Assume context**: Explicitly state what to check
- **Skip validation**: Always verify the outcome
- **Be vague**: "Set up the project" → too broad
- **Hardcode paths**: Use relative paths or configurable variables
- **Require specific LLM**: Should work with any AI

---

## Examples

### Example 1: AWS Deployment

```
User: "Deploy to AWS staging using the deploy-to-aws dossier"

AI: (Follows deploy-to-aws.ds.md dossier)
    ✓ Detected: AWS credentials configured
    ✓ Found: terraform/ configuration
    ✓ Validated: Staging environment exists
    ✓ Running: terraform plan
    ✓ Confirmed: Changes look safe
    ✓ Executing: terraform apply
    ✓ Verified: Deployment successful
    ✓ Output: Staging URL: https://staging.example.com

    "Deployment complete! Staging is live."
```

### Example 2: Project Setup

```
User: "Initialize this Node.js project using project-init dossier"

AI: (Follows project-init.md dossier)
    ✓ Detected: Node.js project (package.json found)
    ✓ Analyzed: Dependencies and scripts
    ✓ Created: Development environment config
    ✓ Set up: .gitignore with Node.js patterns
    ✓ Initialized: Git repository
    ✓ Created: README.md template

    "Project initialized! Ready for development."
```

### Example 3: Database Migration

```
User: "Run the database migration dossier for the user table changes"

AI: (Follows db-migration.md dossier)
    ✓ Detected: PostgreSQL database
    ✓ Validated: Connection to database
    ✓ Created: Backup of current schema
    ✓ Generated: Migration script
    ✓ Reviewed: Changes with user
    ✓ Applied: Migration successfully
    ✓ Verified: Data integrity maintained

    "Migration complete! Backup saved to backups/schema-2025-11-05.sql"
```

## Why This Works

### 1. **Adaptive Intelligence**
LLMs can understand your project's unique structure and adapt dossier instructions accordingly.[^9][^10][^11]

### 2. **Less Code to Maintain**
Dossiers are markdown files with instructions, not complex error-prone scripts.

### 3. **Better Error Handling**
LLMs can troubleshoot and retry intelligently rather than crashing on unexpected input.[^12][^13][^14]

### 4. **User Trust**
Users see what the AI is doing and can guide the process, unlike opaque scripts.

### 5. **Community Extensible**
Anyone can write a dossier - no shell scripting expertise required.

---

## Troubleshooting

### "The AI didn't follow the dossier correctly"

**Causes**:
- Dossier instructions too vague
- Missing context about project structure
- Edge case not documented

**Solutions**:
- Make instructions more explicit
- Add examples of expected output
- Update dossier with troubleshooting section

---

### "Dossier works with Claude but not GPT-4"

**Cause**: LLM-specific assumptions

**Solution**: Make dossier more explicit:
- Avoid relying on tool-specific features
- Be very clear about file paths
- Include step-by-step validation

---

### "I don't have access to an LLM"

If you don't have an LLM agent:
- Dossiers can still serve as excellent documentation
- Follow dossier steps manually
- Use traditional automation scripts alongside dossiers
- Dossiers provide clear workflow documentation even without AI execution

## Philosophy

> "Agents need structure. Dossiers provide it."

Dossiers embody this philosophy - they give AI agents clear structure and guidance, enabling them to intelligently automate complex workflows that would be brittle to script.

**The dossier standard** enables:
- **Adaptability**: LLMs understand context and adjust behavior
- **Maintainability**: Markdown documentation instead of complex scripts
- **Collaboration**: Clear, readable instructions anyone can contribute to
- **Continuous improvement**: Self-improving through the protocol
- **Universal adoption**: Any project, any workflow, any implementation
