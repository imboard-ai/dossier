# Explanation & Concepts

Understanding-oriented documentation that explains how and why Dossier works.

## Core Concepts

- [AI Agents](agents.md) - How AI agents work with dossiers
- [Security Model](security-model.md) - Understanding Dossier's security approach
- [FAQ](faq.md) - Frequently asked questions

## Key Topics

### Security & Trust
- Why cryptographic verification matters
- Checksum vs. signature verification
- Trust models and key management
- Threat mitigation strategies

### Architecture & Design
- Why Markdown for automation
- The role of frontmatter metadata
- Immutable vs. mutable state
- Design philosophy and principles

### Use Cases
- DevOps automation
- Data science workflows
- Security auditing
- Documentation as code

## Philosophy

Dossier is built on these principles:
- **Security by default**: Verify before execution
- **Human-readable**: Markdown that both humans and AI can understand
- **Cryptographically verifiable**: SHA256 and optional signatures
- **Lightweight**: No heavy dependencies or complex infrastructure
- **Open standard**: Community-driven, vendor-neutral
