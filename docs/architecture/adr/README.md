# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for significant architectural decisions in the Dossier project.

## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences.

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows this structure:

```markdown
# ADR-NNNN: Title

## Status
[Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded by ADR-XXXX]

## Context
What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision or change?

## Decision
What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing?

## Consequences
What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change?
```

## Creating a New ADR

1. Copy the template: `cp ../../../rfcs/0000-template.md NNNN-your-decision.md`
2. Use the next available number (NNNN)
3. Write a descriptive title (use kebab-case)
4. Fill in all sections
5. Submit as part of your PR
