# Dossier Official Public Keys

This file contains the official public keys used to sign dossiers published by the Dossier project.

## About Dossier Signatures

Dossiers can be cryptographically signed to verify their authenticity. The project supports a **dual signature system**:
- **AWS KMS (ECDSA-SHA256)**: Official Imboard AI signatures (HSM-backed, enterprise-grade)
- **minisign (Ed25519)**: Community signatures and transparent verification

**Why signatures matter:**
- ✅ **Authenticity**: Verify the dossier comes from a trusted source
- ✅ **Integrity**: Confirm the dossier hasn't been tampered with
- ✅ **Trust**: Build confidence in executing automation workflows

## Official Imboard AI Keys

### AWS KMS Key (Primary)

**Status**: To be generated
**Algorithm**: ECDSA-SHA256 (P-256 curve)
**Key Type**: AWS KMS (HSM-backed, FIPS 140-2 Level 2)
**Purpose**: Official Imboard AI dossier signatures
**Trust Level**: OFFICIAL

The official AWS KMS key will be generated and published here in a future release. This key provides the highest security level with hardware-backed private keys.

### minisign Key (Community Transparency)

**Status**: To be generated
**Algorithm**: Ed25519
**Key Type**: minisign
**Purpose**: Community-verifiable signatures (dual-signing with KMS)
**Trust Level**: OFFICIAL

This key enables verification without AWS credentials, providing transparency for the community.

**How to use** (when available):
```bash
# Add to your trusted keys file
mkdir -p ~/.dossier
echo "RWT... imboard-ai-2024" >> ~/.dossier/trusted-keys.txt
```

## Community Keys

Anyone can sign their own dossiers! If you're publishing dossiers:

1. **Generate your key**:
   ```bash
   # Install minisign
   brew install minisign  # macOS
   # or apt-get install minisign  # Linux

   # Generate key pair
   minisign -G -p your-name-2024.pub -s your-name-2024.key
   ```

2. **Publish your public key**:
   - Add it to your dossier repository
   - Share it in your README
   - Include it in your project documentation

3. **Sign your dossiers**:
   ```bash
   node tools/sign-dossier.js your-dossier.md \\
     --key your-name-2024.key \\
     --key-id your-name-2024 \\
     --signed-by "Your Name <email@example.com>"
   ```

## Trust Model

The Dossier project uses a **decentralized trust model** similar to Docker Hub:

- **Official dossiers**: Signed by Imboard AI (this key)
- **Community dossiers**: Signed by their authors
- **User choice**: You decide which keys to trust

### How to Trust a Key

1. **Verify the key source**: Get the public key from a trusted source (official website, verified repository)

2. **Add to trusted keys**:
   ```bash
   echo "RWT... key-identifier" >> ~/.dossier/trusted-keys.txt
   ```

3. **Format**: Each line is: `<public-key> <key-identifier>`
   ```
   RWTx5V7Kf1KLN8BVF3PqZ... imboard-ai-2024
   RWAbc123xyz... community-author-2024
   ```

### Trust Levels

When you execute a dossier, the verification tool will report:

- ✅ **OFFICIAL**: Valid signature from official Imboard AI keys (AWS KMS or minisign)
- ✅ **TRUSTED**: Valid signature from a community key you explicitly trust
- ⚠️  **SIGNED_UNKNOWN**: Valid signature, but key not in your trusted list
- ⚠️  **UNSIGNED**: No signature (integrity still checked via checksum)
- ❌ **INVALID**: Signature verification failed (DO NOT EXECUTE)

## Verification

### Verify a Dossier

```bash
# Automated verification
node tools/verify-dossier.js path/to/dossier.md

# Manual checksum verification
tail -n +N path/to/dossier.md | shasum -a 256
# Compare with checksum.hash in frontmatter
```

### Verify This File

This file itself should be verified through:
- GitHub commit signatures (GPG)
- Git tags for releases
- Official project website

## Key Rotation

Keys should be rotated periodically for security:

- Official keys: Annually or upon compromise
- Community keys: As needed
- Old keys: Listed as "REVOKED" below when replaced

## Revoked Keys

**None yet**

When a key is compromised or rotated, it will be listed here:
```
# Format: <public-key> <key-identifier> <revoked-date> <reason>
# RWT... imboard-ai-2023 2024-01-15 "Routine rotation"
```
