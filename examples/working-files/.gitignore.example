# Example .gitignore patterns for working files
# Copy relevant patterns to your project's .gitignore

# Option 1: Ignore all working files (most restrictive)
*.dsw.md

# Option 2: Ignore only temporary working files
*-temp.dsw.md
*-wip.dsw.md

# Option 3: Ignore working files in specific directories
/tmp/*.dsw.md
/.cache/*.dsw.md

# Option 4: Ignore specific working files by name
deploy-application.dsw.md
local-dev-setup.dsw.md

# Option 5: Track working files but ignore their backups
*.dsw.md.backup
*.dsw.md.bak
*.dsw.md~

# ---
# Recommendation:
# ---
# Start by committing working files (don't add any patterns).
# If they cause problems (merge conflicts, noise), add patterns as needed.
# Let experience guide your decision.

# Common reasons to gitignore working files:
# - Solo development (no collaboration benefit)
# - Multiple concurrent executions (merge conflict risk)
# - Machine-specific context (not useful to others)
# - Rapid iteration (too much churn in git history)

# Common reasons to commit working files:
# - Team collaboration (share execution progress)
# - Documentation value (record of decisions)
# - Audit trail (compliance or review needs)
# - Resume on different machines (work mobility)
