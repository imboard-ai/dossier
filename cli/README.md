**Enforce cryptographic verification before executing dossiers.**

## The Problem This Solves

**Reality**: LLMs cannot be relied upon to enforce security checks automatically.

Even with MCP server installed and protocol documentation:
- ❌ LLMs may skip verification
- ❌ No automatic enforcement mechanism
- ❌ Security depends on LLM "remembering" to check

**This CLI provides**: Mandatory verification enforced by code, not suggestions.

## Installation

### Option 1: NPM (Recommended)

Install globally:
```bash
npm install -g @ai-dossier/cli
```

Or use without installing:
```bash
npx @ai-dossier/cli <file-or-url>
```

### Option 2: From Source (Development)

```bash
cd cli
npm link  # Links the CLI globally for development

# Or use directly
chmod +x bin/ai-dossier
./bin/ai-dossier verify <file-or-url>
```

---

## Authentication

### Interactive (Browser OAuth)

```bash
dossier login
```

### Non-Interactive (CI/CD, Agents)

Set the `DOSSIER_REGISTRY_TOKEN` environment variable:

```bash
export DOSSIER_REGISTRY_TOKEN=<your-token>

# Optional: set user/org context
export DOSSIER_REGISTRY_USER=<username>
export DOSSIER_REGISTRY_ORGS=org1,org2
```

When `DOSSIER_REGISTRY_TOKEN` is set, it takes precedence over stored credentials. This is recommended for CI/CD pipelines, Docker containers, and AI agent contexts where interactive login is not possible.

Commands that require confirmation (`publish`, `remove`, `cache clean`) will fail with a clear error in non-interactive sessions. Use `-y`/`--yes` to skip confirmation prompts.

---

## Usage

### Basic Verification

```bash
# Verify local file
ai-dossier verify path/to/dossier.ds.md

# Verify remote dossier
ai-dossier verify https://example.com/dossier.ds.md
```

**Exit codes**:
- `0` - Verification passed (safe)
- `1` - Verification failed (unsafe)
- `2` - Error occurred

### Verbose Mode

```bash
ai-dossier verify --verbose path/to/dossier.ds.md
```

Shows:
- Dossier metadata (title, version, risk level)
- Detailed checksum comparison
- Signature verification details
- Complete risk assessment

### Integration with LLM Tools

**Claude Code**:
```bash
# Shell function wrapper
claude-run-dossier() {
  if ai-dossier verify "$1"; then
    claude-code "The dossier at $1 has been verified. Please execute it."
  else
    echo "❌ Security verification failed. Not executing."
  fi
}

# Use it
claude-run-dossier https://example.com/dossier.ds.md
```

**Cursor**:
```bash
cursor-run-dossier() {
  if ai-dossier verify "$1"; then
    cursor "Execute the verified dossier at $1"
  else
    echo "❌ Verification failed"
    return 1
  fi
}
```

**Any LLM Tool**:
```bash
safe-run-dossier() {
  local url="$1"
  local tool="${2:-claude-code}"

  if ai-dossier verify "$url"; then
    echo "✅ Dossier verified. Passing to $tool..."
    "$tool" "run $url"
  else
    echo "❌ Verification failed. Dossier not executed."
    return 1
  fi
}

# Usage
safe-run-dossier https://example.com/dossier.ds.md claude-code
safe-run-dossier https://example.com/dossier.ds.md cursor
```

---

## Registry Commands

### Search

Search for dossiers across all configured registries:

```bash
# Basic search
ai-dossier search "deployment"

# Filter by category
ai-dossier search "ci" --category devops

# Search dossier body content (-c is short for --content)
ai-dossier search "docker" -c

# Limit total results
ai-dossier search "setup" --limit 50

# Paginate results
ai-dossier search "setup" --page 2 --per-page 10

# JSON output
ai-dossier search "auth" --json
```

### List

List dossiers from the registry, a local directory, or a GitHub repo:

```bash
# List all registry dossiers
ai-dossier list --source registry

# List with JSON output
ai-dossier list --source registry --json

# Paginate registry results
ai-dossier list --source registry --page 2 --per-page 10

# Filter by category (registry mode)
ai-dossier list --source registry --category security

# List local dossiers (-r is short for --recursive)
ai-dossier list .
ai-dossier list ./dossiers -r

# List from a GitHub repo
ai-dossier list github:owner/repo

# Filter local/GitHub results by risk level or signed status
ai-dossier list . --risk high
ai-dossier list . --signed-only
```

### Pull

Download dossiers from the registry to the local cache (`~/.dossier/cache/`):

```bash
# Pull a dossier (latest version)
ai-dossier pull org/my-dossier

# Pull a specific version
ai-dossier pull org/my-dossier@1.2.0

# Pull multiple dossiers
ai-dossier pull org/dossier-a org/dossier-b

# Force re-download
ai-dossier pull org/my-dossier --force
```

Pulled dossiers are cached locally with checksum verification. Subsequent `pull` calls skip the download if the version is already cached (use `--force` to override).

### Export

Download a dossier and save it to a local file:

```bash
# Export to default filename (org-name.ds.md)
ai-dossier export org/my-dossier

# Export to a specific file
ai-dossier export org/my-dossier -o ./local-copy.ds.md

# Print to stdout (for piping)
ai-dossier export org/my-dossier --stdout
```

---

## Multi-Registry Resolution

The CLI queries all configured registries in parallel when resolving dossiers (e.g., `dossier get`, `dossier run`, `dossier pull`). This uses `Promise.allSettled()` so a single registry failure does not block results from other registries.

### Exit Codes

Multi-registry commands use the following exit codes:

| Command | `0` (Success) | `1` (Failure) | `2` (Config/Runtime Error) |
|---------|---------------|---------------|---------------------------|
| `get` | Dossier found | Not found in any registry, or all registries failed | — |
| `list --source registry` | Results returned, including when all registries fail (empty list + warnings) | Unexpected runtime error | — |
| `search` | Results returned, including when all registries fail (no matches + warnings) | Unexpected runtime error | — |
| `pull` | At least one item pulled successfully (per-item errors are printed as warnings) | All requested items failed to pull | — |
| `run` | Dossier executed successfully | Not found, fetch failed, or verification failed | No LLM detected, unknown LLM, or execution failed |

**Partial failures**: When some registries fail but at least one succeeds, `list` returns exit `0` with a warning showing which registries failed:
```
⚠️  Registry 'internal': connection timeout
⚠️  Showing partial results (1/2 registries responded)
```

When **all** registries fail, `list` and `search` still exit `0` but display per-registry error warnings and report no results found.

### No Registries Configured

If no registries are configured (no user config, no project `.dossierrc.json`, no `DOSSIER_REGISTRY_URL` env var), the CLI falls back to the hardcoded public registry (`https://dossier-registry.vercel.app`). Commands proceed normally — there is no error or special exit code for this scenario.

### Error Handling

All multi-registry operations return structured errors alongside results:

```
$ dossier get org/my-dossier
# If registry A is down but registry B has it → returns result silently from B
# If no registry has it → displays errors from each registry
```

When **all registries fail**, the CLI displays per-registry error details showing which registry failed and why. When at least one registry succeeds, the result is returned without surfacing errors from other registries.

This means you can configure multiple registries for redundancy — the CLI will succeed as long as at least one registry can serve the requested dossier. Registries are queried in parallel; for `get` and `run`, the first successful result (by configuration order) is used.

### Configuration

See `dossier config` for managing registry URLs. Multiple registries are queried in parallel, not sequentially.

---

## Config Command

Manage CLI settings and registry configuration.

### General Settings

```bash
# List all configuration
dossier config --list

# Get a setting
dossier config defaultLlm

# Set a setting
dossier config defaultLlm claude-code

# Reset to defaults (preserves registry settings)
dossier config --reset
```

### Registry Management

All registry URLs **must use HTTPS** to protect credentials in transit.

```bash
# List configured registries
dossier config --list-registries
dossier config --list-registries --json

# Add a registry
dossier config --add-registry internal --url https://dossier.company.com

# Add as default + read-only
dossier config --add-registry mirror --url https://mirror.example.com --default --readonly

# Remove a registry
dossier config --remove-registry mirror

# Change the default registry
dossier config --set-default-registry internal
```

### Project-Level Config (`.dossierrc.json`)

Place a `.dossierrc.json` in your project root for team-shared registry settings:

```json
{
  "registries": {
    "internal": { "url": "https://dossier.company.com" }
  },
  "defaultRegistry": "internal"
}
```

Project registries are merged with user registries. User-configured registries take precedence on name conflicts to prevent credential exfiltration.

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `DOSSIER_REGISTRY_URL` | Override/add a registry URL (creates virtual "env" registry) |
| `DOSSIER_REGISTRY_TOKEN` | Auth token for the virtual "env" registry (ephemeral, never persisted to disk). Recommended for CI/CD and agent contexts. |
| `DOSSIER_REGISTRY_USER` | Username for registry authentication |
| `DOSSIER_REGISTRY_ORGS` | Comma-separated org scopes for registry queries |

## What It Checks

### 1. Integrity (Checksum)

**Verifies**: Content hasn't been tampered with

**How**:
1. Extracts declared SHA256 hash from frontmatter
2. Calculates actual SHA256 of dossier body
3. Compares hashes

**Result**:
- ✅ Match → Content is intact
- ❌ Mismatch → Content has been modified → **BLOCK**

### 2. Authenticity (Signature)

**Verifies**: Dossier is from claimed author

**How**:
1. Checks if signature present in frontmatter
2. Validates signature format
3. Checks if key is in trusted keys list
4. Verifies signature against content

**Result**:
- ✅ Valid + Trusted → From known author
- ⚠️ Valid + Unknown → Signed but untrusted key
- ❌ Invalid → Signature failed → **BLOCK**
- ⚠️ No signature → Unsigned (warn for high-risk)

### 3. Risk Assessment

**Analyzes**:
- Dossier risk level (low/medium/high/critical)
- Presence of signature (required for high-risk)
- Checksum status
- Combined security posture

**Outputs**:
- Recommendation: ALLOW, WARN, or BLOCK
- Issue list
- Overall risk level

## Registry Configuration

The CLI supports multiple registries for discovering, pulling, and publishing dossiers. Use `dossier config` to manage registries — see [Config Command](#config-command) for CLI usage.

### Configuration File (`~/.dossier/config.json`)

The CLI **auto-creates** `~/.dossier/config.json` the first time you modify settings (e.g., via `dossier config --add-registry`). You do not need to create this file manually. If the file does not exist, the CLI uses built-in defaults (the public registry at `https://dossier-registry.vercel.app`).

```json
{
  "registries": {
    "public": {
      "url": "https://dossier-registry.vercel.app",
      "default": true
    },
    "internal": {
      "url": "https://dossier.internal.example.com"
    },
    "readonly-mirror": {
      "url": "https://mirror.example.com",
      "readonly": true
    }
  },
  "defaultRegistry": "public"
}
```

See [Read-Only Registries](#read-only-registries) for how the `"readonly"` flag affects operations.

To create the config manually:

```bash
mkdir -p -m 700 ~/.dossier
cat > ~/.dossier/config.json << 'EOF'
{
  "registries": {
    "public": {
      "url": "https://dossier-registry.vercel.app",
      "default": true
    }
  }
}
EOF
chmod 600 ~/.dossier/config.json
```

### Resolution Priority

1. `--registry` flag on the command
2. `DOSSIER_REGISTRY_URL` environment variable
3. Project-level `.dossierrc.json`
4. User-level `~/.dossier/config.json`
5. Hardcoded default (public registry)

To verify which registries are active and their resolution order, run:

```bash
dossier config --list-registries
```

### Read-Only Registries

Registries marked `"readonly": true` can be used for read operations (`search`, `get`, `pull`) but **block write operations** (`publish`, `remove`). Attempting a write operation against a read-only registry produces:

```
❌ Registry 'readonly-mirror' is read-only
```

When resolving a write target (e.g., for `publish`), the CLI skips read-only registries and falls back to the first writable registry. If all configured registries are read-only, the CLI returns:

```
❌ No writable registry configured. All registries are read-only.
```

### Per-Command Registry Flag

Write commands accept `--registry <name>` to target a specific registry:

```bash
ai-dossier publish --registry team my-dossier.ds.md
ai-dossier login --registry internal
```

Read commands (`search`, `get`, `pull`) query all configured registries in parallel.

---

## Agent Discovery (`--agent`)

The `--agent` flag outputs a machine-readable JSON manifest describing the CLI's capabilities. This is designed for AI agents that need to discover what the CLI can do programmatically:

```bash
ai-dossier --agent
```

Output includes:
- CLI version and available commands
- Supported flags (`--json`, `-y`/`--yes`)
- Capabilities (multi-registry, non-TTY safe, machine-readable errors)
- Discovery command for full command listing

This enables agents to auto-configure their integration with the Dossier CLI without parsing help text.

## Architecture

### How It Works

```
User Command:
ai-dossier verify https://example.com/dossier.ds.md
         ↓
    Download/Read File
         ↓
    Parse Frontmatter
    (Extract metadata)
         ↓
    Calculate SHA256
    (Dossier body only)
         ↓
    Compare Hashes
    ┌────────┴────────┐
    ↓                 ↓
MATCH              MISMATCH
    ↓                 ↓
Check Signature    BLOCK (exit 1)
    ↓
Assess Risk
    ↓
Exit 0 (safe) or 1 (unsafe)
```

### Design Principles

1. **Fail Secure**: Default to blocking on any verification failure
2. **Exit Codes**: Machine-readable results for scripting
3. **Clear Output**: Human-readable for manual use
4. **Minimal Dependencies**: Core verification + commander CLI framework
5. **Fast**: Verification in milliseconds

---

## Limitations

### Current Limitations

1. **Signature Verification**: Basic implementation
   - Detects test signatures (invalid/fake)
   - Full minisign verification requires external tool
   - Future: Native minisign support

2. **Trusted Keys**: Not yet implemented
   - Future: Check against ~/.dossier/trusted-keys.txt
   - Future: Key management commands

3. **Execution**: --run flag not implemented
   - Currently just verifies
   - Future: Execute if verification passes

### Why These Limitations Exist

**Current status**: MVP for verification enforcement
**Focus**: Get checksum verification working reliably
**Future**: Full signature verification, trust management, execution

**But even with limitations**:
- ✅ Checksum verification catches tampering
- ✅ Signature presence detection works
- ✅ Exit codes enable integration
- ✅ Enforces security before LLM involvement

## Troubleshooting

### "insecure permissions" warning

```
⚠️  Warning: ~/.dossier/credentials.json has insecure permissions (644). Expected 0600. Credentials may have been compromised. Fixing permissions.
```

**What it means**: The credentials file is readable by other users on the system. The CLI expects `0600` (owner read/write only) to protect your authentication tokens.

**How to fix**:

```bash
chmod 600 ~/.dossier/credentials.json
```

The CLI will also attempt to fix permissions automatically when it detects this issue.

**Common causes**:
- Manually creating or editing the file with a text editor
- Copying the file from another system without preserving permissions
- Running the CLI as a different user than the file owner

### "Failed to save credentials"

```
Failed to save credentials to ~/.dossier/credentials.json: <reason>
```

**What it means**: The CLI could not write to the credentials file after `dossier login` or a token refresh.

**How to fix**:

1. **Check directory exists**: The config directory `~/.dossier/` must exist. The CLI creates it automatically, but if creation failed:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.dossier
   chmod 700 ~/.dossier
   ```

2. **Check write permissions**: Ensure your user owns the directory and file:
   ```bash
   ls -la ~/.dossier/
   # If ownership is wrong:
   sudo chown -R $(whoami) ~/.dossier
   ```

3. **Check disk space**: Ensure the filesystem has available space.

4. **Check for read-only filesystem**: In some container or CI environments, the home directory may be read-only. Use the `DOSSIER_REGISTRY_TOKEN` environment variable instead:
   ```bash
   export DOSSIER_REGISTRY_TOKEN=<your-token>
   ```

### "Registry not found"

```
Registry 'myregistry' not found. Available: public. Run 'dossier config --list-registries' to see configured registries.
```

**What it means**: The `--registry` flag references a registry name that isn't configured.

**How to fix**:

1. List configured registries to see what's available:
   ```bash
   dossier config --list-registries
   ```

2. Add the missing registry:
   ```bash
   dossier config --add-registry myregistry --url https://dossier.example.com
   ```

### "Unreachable registry URL"

When a registry is unreachable, the error appears as part of per-registry error output:

```
❌ Not found in any registry: org/my-dossier
   internal: fetch failed
```

**What it means**: The registry URL is not reachable — the server may be down, the URL may be wrong, or there may be a network/firewall issue. When using multiple registries, the CLI succeeds as long as at least one registry responds (see [Multi-Registry Resolution](#multi-registry-resolution)).

**How to fix**:

1. Verify the URL is correct:
   ```bash
   dossier config --list-registries
   curl -s https://dossier.company.com/health
   ```

2. If the URL is wrong, remove and re-add:
   ```bash
   dossier config --remove-registry internal
   dossier config --add-registry internal --url https://correct-url.company.com
   ```

### "Malformed config file"

```
⚠️  Warning: Could not read config file (Unexpected token ...), using defaults
```

**What it means**: The config file contains invalid JSON. The CLI **does not fail** — it logs a warning and falls back to built-in defaults.

**How to fix**:

1. Validate the JSON:
   ```bash
   python3 -m json.tool < ~/.dossier/config.json
   ```

2. Fix syntax errors, or delete and recreate:
   ```bash
   rm ~/.dossier/config.json
   dossier config --add-registry public --url https://dossier-registry.vercel.app --default
   ```

## FAQ

### Q: Why a separate CLI tool?

**A**: Security cannot be enforced through LLM instructions alone. We need code-level enforcement that runs **before** LLMs get involved.

### Q: Does this replace MCP server?

**A**: No, they're complementary:
- **CLI**: Enforcement layer (verify before execution)
- **MCP server**: Convenience layer (tools for LLMs)

Use both for best results.

### Q: Can I use this with any LLM tool?

**A**: Yes! The CLI is tool-agnostic. Create a wrapper function for your specific tool.

### Q: What if I don't want to install it?

**A**: Use the verification script from SECURITY_STATUS.md or manually verify checksums.
